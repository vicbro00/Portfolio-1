Thing to improve in Semester Project 1:

  -**Style guide:**

    -Average 3 points

    -A style guide is a blueprint of the design of a website. 
    It should contain most of the aspect of the design such typography, color scheme, components, icons, images etc You style guide missed most of these. 
    Lots of components, icons etc are shown in the design but not in the style guide. I advise you consider this going forward.
